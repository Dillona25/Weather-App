Weather App

This is a super simple app I created to familiarize myself with API implementation. The app allows users to input any city and then the app will get them the local weather while also displaying a different image respectfully. I love the design of this app and would love to make some additions in the future, heres what:
<br />

1.  A 7 day forecast for the according city the user inputs.
2.  A drop down menu that allows the user to select which country.
3.  A dropdown menu that allows the user to select a city based on the first few characters with respect to the entered country.
4.  And an element that shows the time of day for the location as well!
